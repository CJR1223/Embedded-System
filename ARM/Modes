Modes will automatically change when interupted
we donot want to change the mode manually by writing program it will automatically change

Interupt Service Routine : When processor Interupted It would run ISR.Processor the execution of main function wil execute ISR.
ISR is a function that is user defined

There modes are given to data security


modes:
* User mode:
  normal program execution mode
  it is non priviledged mode

* Supervisor mode:
  It is default mode of ARM processor after reset
     pressing reset button automatically move to suupervisor

  In embedded system : after reset->startup code-> main funtion   the startup code do some functioning and then give control to main function

  IN ARM processor   : after reset->supervisor mode-> user mode

* Faster Interupt Request(FIQ)  Interupt Request mode(IRQ)
  FIQ-> high priority
  IRQ->low priority

  due to FIQ ARM becomes popular
  lets take a scenario  in case of airbag depletion that the crash detection system would call the interupt that the interupt is called and then the airbag is deployed
  similarly in IRQ mode USR mode will be changed to IRQ mode after execution of IRQ mode the IRQ mode will switch back to FIQ mode.

* Abort mode
  if the processor fetches data from reserve memory space then the procesor enter to abort mode
  like segmentation fault when the processor fetches data from reserved  interupt gets generated and goea to abort mode.

* Undefined mode 
  If any undefined instruction is fetched,then processor enetrs to undefined mode

  V4T can understand THUMB
  when given to v3 that thumb instructions are undefined.
  if any undefined processor not understand ,then processor goas to undefined mode

* system mode
  it is priviledged mode for USER .

  USR mode and system mode considerd as same mode.we can execute normal program in priviledged mode for that function should enter into system mode

suppose CPSR reg usage is unknown it would stop program execution then CPSR should be changed for that to continue again.

USR/sys mode will have common stack both have same stack
every mode has its own stack
any stack data in USR stack willnot develop with FIQ stack
that is ccalled data security
Every mode has own stack and data will not overlap Hence data security.
