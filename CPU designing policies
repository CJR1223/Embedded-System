  CISC                                                   RISC
--------                                               --------
* complex instruction set computing                   * Reduced instruction set computing
* It consist of complex and simple instructions       * it consists pn;y simple instructions
* agenda: To reduce instructions per program          * agenda:to reduce clock pluses instruction
* multi clock cycle instructions                      * single clock cycle instructio
* logic gate are more inside processor                * logic gates are less inside processor
* power consumption is more and heat discipation high * power consumption is less and heat discipation is also low
* Die size is larger compared to RISC chip            * die size is smaller compared to CISC
* compiler designing is simple                        * compiler designing is difficult
*eg: all intel processor,i3,i5... 8086,8051 CPU..     * ARM,AVR,PIC...



HARVARD                                                       VON-NEUMANN ARCHITECTURES
---------                                                     ----------------------------
* Harward  CPU have seperate program memory and data memory    * single memory that can be used as data memory and program memory.
* eg:8051 CPU                                                  * ARM7
   AVR CPU                                                       All intel processor 
   PIC CPU
* if address bus is 16 bit then max memory is address bus      * if address bus is 32 bit then max memory is address bus 
  2^16=64B                                                        2^32=4GB

if to read and write anything both of them use bus to point towards the memory location.
