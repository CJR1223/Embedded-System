Undersatnd processor outside microcontroller will be faster when compared to outside.
software is used in microcontroller varies from product to product

there are mainly 2 categories of microcontrollers
   * Dual inline package 
   * Quad flat package

Advance Microcontrollers
------------------------
* power consumption is low.
* rate is low
* Battery controlled microcontrollers is best.

Inside Microcontrollers
------------------------
* processor
* memory RAM and Flash memory 
* PLL 
* UART
* I2C
* SPI
* CAN
* GPIO PORTS
* Timer Counters

if processor doesnot come with internal memory, External RAM and external RAM is mandatory for this processor.
microcontroller comes with everything inbuilt.
Microcontroller also called small computer on chip Also known as System On Chip.(SOC)
since microcontrollers power consumption is low heat consumption also low.



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MICROCONTROLLER AND MICROPROCESSOR
------------------------------------------------------

MICROPROCESSOR                                            MICROCONTROLLERs
--------------                                            ----------------
* MP is called as chip on computer                        MC is called as System On Chip
* MP doesnot comes with inbuilt memory and                MC comes with inbuilt processor memory and 
  peripherals like uart,timer,adc,gpio                    peripherals like uard,timer,adc,gpio 
* MP is designed for computer and laptops                 MC is designed for embedded systems
* Power consumption is more on MP based products          power consumption is less
* Heat discipation is more                                heat discipation is low
* products are costlier                                   products are cheaper
* MP based product are bigger in size                     MC based products are smaller in size
* 8085,8086,i3,i5,i7                                      8051 famile,AVR family,PIC,ARM
